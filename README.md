# Charlie-Munn-Professional-Profile

### Hi, I'm Charlie Munn 
I'm an aspiring cybersecurity professional, currently studying and just beginning my journey in the IT industry. I'm passionate about ethical hacking, digital forensics, and building tools that help me—and hopefully others—understand systems more deeply.  

Eager to learn as much as I can, I'm using this space to share projects, document my growth, and contribute to the cybersecurity community. Whether it's writing Python scripts, exploring new vulnerabilities, or automating tasks, I'm always looking for opportunities to build, break (ethically), and improve.
